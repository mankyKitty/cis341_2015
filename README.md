CIS 341 - Compilers
===================

This is my run through of the (CIS-341
Compilers)[https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis341/current/] course from UPenn.

Still using OCaml, because I want to learn what the hub-bub about it is and
because compilers are cool.

...What?

Compilers are cool, deal with it.
